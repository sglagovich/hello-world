# hello-world
Just starting out
<i>Playing around with some things here.</i>
I'm a Bioinformatics major, focusing on visualization and modeling software. We can manipulate our computers to do wonderful things for us and solve some of the problems we may have in our lives, and that's what I want to be able to do.
I don't know everything there is to know about coding, but hopefully I can learn a lot by contributing here and in my classes.
